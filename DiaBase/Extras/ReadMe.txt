the following files need to be copied to the folder "Extras" in the apps working folder

NTPickUp.ntj
NTMuleLogging.ntj
CPickUp.ntj
CBMuleLogging.ntj
DiabloFont1.ttf

Clobot.dll needs to be copied to same folder as the Diabase.exe

game.js needs to go into Scripts folder, this wont be needed later, hoping to do away with any js script files.
